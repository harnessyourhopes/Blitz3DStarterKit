# Blitz3D Starter Kit

This is a wip obviously from the little features there are but I plan on adding a lot of utility items that games would need along with a game configuration file for global low security variables (such as FPS, etc)

I'm kind of doing things like I would in other engines because I can't really find all that much documentation about this engine and I'm heavily against using AI (although it probably wouldn't be able to find much either)

# Feature TODO

- Better Key scanning system (Blitz3D's original implementation is terrible)
- Manage sounds and assets

# Bug Fix TODO

- Fix choppy PositionEntity calls (its almost like its rounding?)
